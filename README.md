This project makes it easier for organizations and individuals to send emails to multiple email addresses simultaneously. Through this program, you can specify a large number of email addresses you want to send to, attach a file, and send messages without opening your Gmail account. This project helps in saving time and also provides privacy, allowing users to send emails without being able to read incoming messages. This project is secure and under development, with improved versions to be released in the future.
